# rohandvivedi.com
This is a web application hosted on rohandvivedi.com,
sole purpose : showcase projects and act as internet hosted resume
I plan to destribute this app in future, and so I am designing it with a good backend.

to setup :
 * ``sudo -E bash ./setup.sh &``
 * for production use  ``sudo -E bash ./deploy.sh prod &``

to deploy :
 * ``sudo -E bash ./deploy.sh &``
 * for production use  ``sudo -E bash ./deploy.sh prod &``

*Note: you may replace **bash** with **sh**, if it works on your machine*

to access DB in console:
 * you need sqlite3 shell ``sudo apt-get install sqlite3``
 * ***you do not need to install sqlite3 library for deploying, go will get its own binaries, while setup.***
 * ``sqlite3 ./db/data.db``

to delete the database
 * ``rm ./db/data.db``

to change application configurations
 * use `dev_config.json` and `prod_config.json` according to the requirement, for your environment

to setup new owner
 * delete the database file
 * update the owner.json file
 * deploy
 * then use sqlite3 shell, to insert rest of the data (I know, this will become easier after the admin panel is developed)

The Schema is public

 * table: persons (this mostly would carry only 1 entry of the owner of this project)
