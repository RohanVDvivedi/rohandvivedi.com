	            	This app with a mediocre looking front end, is literally a miracle by me.
	            	Its tech stack includes
	            	 ReactJS for front end (with react router)
	            	 backend is go
	            	 Database is an embedded sqlite3 database

	            	 I know right, database for a portfolio application?
	            	 No I literally do not even have 100 software projects under my belt.
	            	 I built this application not just to fulfill my interest and smug off my fullfillments in my life,
	            	 I built it to showcase my webdevelopment abilities,
	            	 I have built it to showcase, to what extent I can go to over engineer my projects.

	            	This is not the best way to do it, but you get it.
	            	I like making projects, this is my brain child, more over when I strted this project.
	            	I did not wanted to make a portfolio for my self, I wanted to make an application that any one can use,
	            	by just entering his/her information and details.

	            	I wanted to make a porfolio that would grab the user's details github repo from github apis,
	            	index the readme files, and build a search index for only his/her projects.
	            	but I can see, that every developer (be is software developer, game dev, UI/UX etc all have their own needs)

	            	My project doe not fit all their needs.
	            	but what I could really do is to automate my life, I do not really like, updating about myself or my projects
	            	I literally hate documenting my projects.

	            	So built this app to do something similar for me. It uses all of my github repos, and stores it all in a databse
	            	it even updates my information from linkedin.

	            	and my resume from my own google drive.

	            	Ya I know, this is so over kill, but I want you to sit back read this text, browse my code, and my be appreciate my work.
	            	Thank you.
	            	Rohan Dvivedi,
	            	Creator of rohandvivedi.com,
	            	and numerous of my projects and ideas that may be noone will ever use, but they atleast indulge me.
