Data injestion
 * (* today) add images to projects

Front end
 * chat client aapi formalized, cache details about users and groups by connection id and name
 * cache callbacks and use then, add gc for them on browser
 * allow edit button every where to the owner, and show it only if the client is owner
 * show gallery of project image on clicking, enlarge images in clicking in a modal or start youtube embed video in that modal (* future)
 * build live-chat page, with no message store on the backend application, messages get stored only on the client side, and end to end client to client encryption using the web crypto api (* future)
 * provide users with a portal to give them a very simple CV in google docs and in pdf (* future)

Backend
 * (* future) perform network io on check connection outside the main lock, name and certain details based user/group search, get details about user or group, send message to user or group 
 by their name (cache names vs connection ids), notify all about the user logged in and logged out, especially to all the people in the group, notify to all user's connections when the user logged in or out, use reader writer lock for the datastructure instead of the mutex
 * name and publicKey to atomically updated in session
 * logout of all connections of a user session of a device, simultaneously
 * create url based owner login system, and an api to check if the client is owner, to allow client side to show different content
 * use separate database for sessions and users data for other users (except the owner) in future (*in far future), use in memeory separately hosted sql database, so we could keep the same schema (example memsql)
 * allow your self to build structured database backed blogging logic for your application, which includes like, share, comment functionality (* far future)
